It is the eroded remnants of a mountain range formed 1.2 billion years ago.

Kimmel declared Dildo to be the sister city of Hollywood, even going so far as to build a Hollywood-style sign that now looks over the town."

The people who live there are citizens of France and even though you can reach the islands by ferry, the euro is the currency and you'll need an adapter for the electrical sockets."
